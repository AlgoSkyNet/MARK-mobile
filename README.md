# MARK-mobile
Mobile Assets Real-Time Keeper  MARK is a risk management solution aimed to secure and protect your vehicles along with its cargo and passengers. It combines the power of a GPS (Global Positioning System) device and a software program that allows you to record vehicle and employee details, plot landmarks, create a delivery dispatch (pick-up and destination), pinpoint the vehicle’s present location and know its as speed, direction, mileage in real time.  MARK is also the only GPS system which is supported by a 24/7 call centre/monitoring station for dispatching and active tracking of vehicle and cargo until safely delivered to its destination. Furthermore, the 24/7 call centre provides emergency assistance service for vehicle breakdown, towing, medical service, and even security response through its own network and the local police. It is like having your own 9-1-1. Increase your income by reducing operational inefficiency, making accurate logistic decisions, reducing insurance cost, providing better customer service and most important of all, enhancing the safety and security of your vehicle, cargo and lives.  With MARK, you get premium values more than what you pay for.  ←Back Features→
